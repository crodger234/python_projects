Summary: Banking_app.py is a basic application where the customer starts off with $0 in their account. 
Then they can either choose from the start to withdrawal or deposit money in the account. They only have those two options or it will come back saying invalid. 
Once they perform a transaction it will ask them if they want to perform another. They will respond with yes or no. If no is chosen the program will stop and show them their final balance. 


How to start the app:
1. Need to download the banking_app.py or could download the directory. 
2. I would recommend open the banking_app.py file in Visual Studio code. 
3. Is open the terminal in your computer. 
4. Then locate the directory where you stored the banking_app.py file. 
5. Then in the terminal type "python banking_app.py"

There is still some user input errors I want to add to the program. But please go ahead an try the program out and let me know what you think. I build the program using Python and Object-Oriented-Programming.
